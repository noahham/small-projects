# Small Projects

This repository is where I put the ugly, horribly made projects that let me learn new things.

## Why this exists

This repo contains various bite-sized projects I worked on to:

- Learn new programming languages or frameworks
- Understand algorithms and data structures
- Try out tools, libraries, and APIs

These projects might be absolutely disgusting, but each one taught me something new.

## What You'll Find

Each folder contains a self-contained mini project with its own README. Here's a list of the projects (in order of oldest &rarr; newest):

- *Escape the Space Station*:&emsp;My first ever Java program.
- *Color Palette*:&emsp;Using random Python libraries and actually solving one of my real world problems.
- *Countdown*:&emsp;My first ever Swift project.
