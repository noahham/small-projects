# Escape-The-Space-Station

This is a text-based game created as a final project for AP Computer Science A.

You are an astronaut in an failing space station. Your objective? 
Get. Out.

In the game, you will have to complete 3 objectives to successfully survive. Along the way, your oxygen levels will be depleting, and can only be replenished if you pick up and use oxygen tanks, which could be found in any room and might grant either a small or large amount of oxygen.
